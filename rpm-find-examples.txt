Other Usefull rpm commands

Same as:
rpm -qlp RPMS-TO-SEARCH | \
grep FILE-TO-SEARCH-FOR

q - query
l - list files
p - packages

Good ones are:
--------------

1. Find the rpm which FILE (path/filename) belongs to
rpm -qf FILE

2. Verify rpm files (changes, MD5, permissions, owner, ...)
rpm -qV RPM_PACKAGE_NAME

3. List packages ordered by SIZE
rpm -qa --qf "%{SIZE} %{NAME}\n" | sort -n

4. Repackage OLD files (make rollback rpm) when upgrading an rpm
rpm --repackage -Uvh NEW_RPM_PACKAGE
