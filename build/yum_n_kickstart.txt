YUM & Kickstart Server

pvcreate /dev/<disk name>
vgcreate vg_yum /dev/<disk name>
lvcreate -L10G -nlv_yum vg_root
mkfs -t ext3 /dev/vg_root/lv_yum
mkdir /yum

Add the following to the /etc/fstab file.
/dev/vg_root/lv_yum /yum ext3 defaults 1 3

Issue the following command to mount the newly formated LV.
mount /yum

We need to know create the YUM and Kickstart directory structure and copy files into it.
In /yum create the following structure.
/yum/
|--> ConfigFiles/
|
|--> Kickstart/
| |--> RHEL5/
|
|--> Nagios/
|
|--> Nessus/
|
|--> OtherMisc/
|
|--> RHEL5/
| |--> base/
| |--> cluster/
| |--> clusterstorage/
| |--> updates/
| +--> virtual/
|
+--> XenUpdates/

Now that we have a structure, it needs to be populated with the necessary data.
Copy the contents of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Installlation CDs (1 thru 5) to
/yum/Kickstart/RHEL5. This is for the Kickstart environment.
Once done, copy the RPMS from there to the YUM environment in /yum/RHEL5.
cp /yum/Kickstart/Server/*.rpm /yum/RHEL5/base/
cp /yum/Kickstart/Cluster/*.rpm /yum/RHEL5/cluster/
cp /yum/Kickstart/ClusterStorage/*.rpm /yum/RHEL5/clusterstorage/
cp /yum/Kickstart/VT/*.rpm /yum/RHEL5/virtual/
You now have the structure and files copied from the CDs in their proper places.

At this point you all the RPMs in their right places and are ready to make YUM repositories out of
them. To do this, the createrepo tool must first be installed. Issue the following command to install
it.
rpm -Uvh /yum/RHEL5/base/createrepo*

Once the RPM has finished installing, 'cd' into each directory and run the createrepo command.
cd /yum/Nagios
createrepo ./
cd /yum/Nessus
createrepo ./
cd /yum/OtherMisc
createrepo ./
cd /yum/XenUpdates
createrepo ./
cd /yum/RHEL5/base
createrepo ./
cd /yum/RHEL5/updates
createrepo ./
cd /yum/RHEL5/virtual
createrepo ./
cd /yum/RHEL5/cluster
createrepo ./
cd /yum/RHEL5/cluserstorage
createrepo ./

Before Kickstart and YUM are useful, you need to install HTTPD to server the RPMS to other 
servers. Since this is the YUM server, and its not up yet, the following software will need to be
installed manually from the YUM base repository.
? httpd
? apr
? apr-util
? postgresql-libs
cd /yum/RHEL5/base
rpm -Uvh httpd apr apr-util postgresql-libs
NOTE: Do not start HTTPD until told to do so later in the instructions.

HTTPD needs to be configured next. Place the following information into a new file called
'/etc/httpd/conf.d/yum.conf'.
Alias /yum "/yum/"
<Directory "/yum/">
Options Indexes MultiViews
AllowOverride None
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
</Directory>
Alias /Kickstart "/yum/Kickstart/RHEL5/"
<Directory "/yum/Kickstart/RHEL5/">
Options Indexes MultiViews
AllowOverride None
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
</Directory>
Next we need to change ownership and privileges on the yum directory before we start HTTPD.
chown -R apache:apache /yum
chmod -R 755 /yum

Now open ports 80 to allow http:// traffic to the server. Run the following commands.
iptables -A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
service iptables save
service iptables restart

OK, Now you can restart HTTPD. I know you have been really wanting to, so go ahead and do
so now. After starting the service, run the 'chkconfig' command to ensure it starts on reboot.
service httpd start
chkconfig --levels 2345 httpd on
#===============================
# YUM Repo file
#===============================
[RHEL5-Base]
name=RHEL5 Base
baseurl=http://<yum server name>/yum/RHEL5/base/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
[RHEL5-Update]
name=RHEL5 Updates
baseurl=http://<yum server name>/yum/RHEL5/updates/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

You will need to move the RedHat-5.bash created above and place it in the '/yum/ConfigFiles/' directory.

One last time change permissions and ownership of the /yum FS.
chown -R apache:apache /yum
chmod -R 755 /yum
