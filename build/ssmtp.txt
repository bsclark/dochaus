Install SSMTP:
1- SSMTP is a very very simple emailer. It is used in replacement of the much heavier sendmail.
We are going to use it because there is no local Smart Relay
host on the network. Also by not using sendmail, we do not
have to worry about email sent to the server as there is no
SMTP daemon or port 25 running/listening.
2- We will need a email account setup on the mail server. The account nagiosalerts was created on it for this purpose.
3- Ensure sendmail is not running and not configured to run on boot.
service sendmail stop
chkconfig –levels 0123456 sendmail off
4- Install the package.
yum install ssmtp
5- Edit the file '/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf'. The following items in RED need to be changed and/or
added.
##
/etc/ssmtp.conf -- a config file for sSMTP sendmail.
##
See the ssmtp.conf(5) man page for a more verbose explanation of the
# available options.
#
# The person who gets all mail for userids < 500
# Make this empty to disable rewriting.
root=user@domainname.com
# The place where the mail goes. The actual machine name is required
# no MX records are consulted. Commonly mailhosts are named mail.domain.com
# The example will fit if you are in domain.com and your mailhub is so named.
mailhub=mailserver.fqdn
# Example for SMTP port number 2525
# mailhub=mail.your.domain:2525
# Example for SMTP port number 25 (Standard/RFC)
# mailhub=mail.your.domain
# Example for SSL encrypted connection
# mailhub=mail.your.domain:465
# Where will the mail seem to come from?
RewriteDomain=domainname
# The full hostname
#Hostname=
# Set this to never rewrite the "From:" line (unless not given) and to
# use that address in the "from line" of the envelope.
FromLineOverride=YES
# Use SSL/TLS to send secure messages to server.
#UseTLS=YES
# Use SSL/TLS certificate to authenticate against smtp host.
#UseTLSCert=YES
# Use this RSA certificate.
#TLSCert=/etc/ssl/certs/ssmtp.pem
# Get enhanced (*really* enhanced) debugging information in the logs
# If you want to have debugging of the config file parsing, move this option
# to the top of the config file and uncomment
#Debug=YES
# Your email account
AuthUser=user@domainname.com
# The password for the email account
AuthPass=password

You can test this by running the following command.
cat /etc/hosts|/usr/sbin/sendmail.ssmtp user@domainname
