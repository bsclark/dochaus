Installation of Nessus Activation Code
This step requires you to be a registered user on the Nessus site. At the time of this writing, the
lagged no-fee option is being used. If not done already, go to http://www.nessus.org/register and fill
out the form. An Activation Code will be emailed to you. Once you have the code, do the following.
/opt/nessus/bin/nessus-fetch --register <reg code>

as it will verify the code and then download any new plugins.


A hole needs to be created for the Nessus Client to be able to connect to the server to run scans.
iptables -A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 1241 -j ACCEPT
service iptables save
service iptables restart

To preform a scan, create a file called 'nessus-targets' in roots home directory with server names in
it, one per line and run the following command.
/opt/nessus/bin/nessus -q -T text -x localhost 1241 nessus-admin mynessus ./nessustargets-nessus-scan-results
