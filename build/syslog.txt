Syslog Configuration

Syslog is used to store the firewall and switch logs. In order for this to work, the following needs
to be added to '/etc/syslog.conf'. Items in RED need to be added. The two lines in red should go at
the end of the file.
# Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher.
# Don't log private authentication messages!
*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none;!local5.*;!local6.*
/var/log/messages
# Switches and Friewall logs
local5.* /var/log/switches/edge.log
local6.* /var/log/switches/jibbitz_core_juniper_fw.log


The '/etc/sysconfig/syslog' needs to have the '-r' option added like below in RED.
# Options to syslogd
# -m 0 disables 'MARK' messages.
# -r enables logging from remote machines
# -x disables DNS lookups on messages recieved with -r
# See syslogd(8) for more details
SYSLOGD_OPTIONS="-m 0 -r"


The Firewall rules need to be modified to allow in syslog traffic.
iptables -A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p udp -m state --state NEW -m udp --dport 514 -j ACCEPT
service iptables save
service iptables restart


The log Files need to be created and Syslog restarted.
touch /var/log/switches/edge.log
touch /var/log/switches/jibbitz_core_juniper_fw.log
service syslogd restart
