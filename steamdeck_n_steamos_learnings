Mirror list

Pacman commands
  pacman -Ql sublime-text       # show files for sublime-text pacakage

Sublime Text install (from: https://gist.github.com/sanyer/ce815296bc4fac38752673d20e7fb3f2)
  curl -O https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg
  sudo pacman-key --add sublimehq-pub.gpg
  sudo pacman-key --lsign-key 8A8F901A
  rm sublimehq-pub.gpg 
  echo -e "\n[sublime-text]\nServer = https://download.sublimetext.com/arch/stable/x86_64" | sudo tee -a /etc/pacman.conf
  sudo pacman -Syu sublime-text

I got these errors when I tried the above
  sublime-text: /opt/sublime_text/plugin_host-3.3 exists in filesystem
  sublime-text: /opt/sublime_text/plugin_host-3.8 exists in filesystem
  sublime-text: /opt/sublime_text/sublime_text exists in filesystem
  Errors occurred, no packages were upgraded.
So I had to do this. The files were most likely from another non-pacman install I tried and forgot about. 
  sudo pacman -S sublime-text --overwrite "/opt/sublime_text/*"
Then I ran into this error
  touch: setting times of '/usr': Read-only file system
To resolve
  sudo steamos-readonly disable
Install then reneable
  sudo steamos-readonly enable

Install Flatpak
  sudo pacman -S flatpak

  warning: Public keyring not found; have you run 'pacman-key --init'?
  downloading required keys...
  error: keyring is not writable
  error: required key missing from keyring
  error: failed to commit transaction (could not find or read file)
  Errors occurred, no packages were upgraded.

The fix
  sudo pacman-key --init
  sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux
  sudo pacman-key --populate holo
  sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring
